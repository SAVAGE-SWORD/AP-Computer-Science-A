This was a really cool assignment! I liked how the lesson teaches me the practical 
benefits of abstract classes and polymorphism, and allows me to better utilize this 
to make the Elevens Lab easier.

The code for the different method were not difficult and I did them rather easily. 
I know this is not taught in the course, but what I wish we could learn is not the 
Board part of this assignment, but rather the GUI and display portions. It is one 
thing to have text printed on screen, but it's a whole other level when there are 
literal digital cards and buttons displayed in an "app" on my computer!!!
