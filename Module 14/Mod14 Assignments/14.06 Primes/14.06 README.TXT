This is a really cool assignment! I like how the instructions give me total 
liberty on how I can make the program and how I achieve the end result. Of course, 
I am being graded on the code, so that's no excuse to do it poorly!

I already have previous knowledge on prime numbers in mathematics and I knew about 
the Sieve of Eratosthenes,which is his ancient algorithm for calculating prime 
numbers. If I wanted to use that logic, I'd need an array of booleans and a 
recurring pattern iÂ² + (n * 1) to check, but I didn't want to use this.

Instead, I found my own solution similar to a segmented sieve that works just as 
well. If you didn't know, I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to mathematical proofs!
