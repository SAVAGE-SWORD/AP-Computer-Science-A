This is one of my favorite assignments yet! I really like "codebreaking" and 
cryptography, and it was really fun to build a Caesar shift. This was actually 
slightly easier than I thought it would be. 

My only (very minor) mishap was making sure I correctly shifted the letters 
according to their alphanumeric position and the shift key. Also, I was initially 
confused with the difference between a class constant and a class variable. The 
constants use "final" whereas the variable doesn't, even though they are both 
declared as static variables in the class itself. 

One thing I feel is that the code itself is redundant, since both the Encryption 
and Decryption classes share almost identical code. It may just be me, but I wonder 
if this was actually the most efficient way of approaching this assignment...
