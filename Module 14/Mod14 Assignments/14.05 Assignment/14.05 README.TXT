This was an easy assignment, but very useful. I remember when I was doing these 
specific projects that it was very cumbersome to constantly add the prefix "my" to 
all my uses of the instance varables. I would have times where I would accidentally 
use the parameter variables only to receive an error, and then have to fix all the 
wrong variables in the code. 

By using "this," I can keep the same name and not make mistakes when it comes to 
referencing the correct variables. While it is good to know, I am very much used to 
the old way of using a prefix and I may not switch how I've learned it. I wish this 
was taught earlier in the course!
