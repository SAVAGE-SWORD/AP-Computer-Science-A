When I first read the lesson and assignment topic, I was really intimidated by what 
I had to do. But after getting into it, I felt that it wasn't that bad. When you 
break it down into mental pseudocode, all you have to do is pick random values and 
determine if they fall in the dartboard or not. Then, divide the hits by the total 
values and multiply by 4.

Looking at the rubric, it talks about using arrays. However, as you'll notice from 
the code, I didn't use an array. I admit I could have stored each value of pi into 
an array, but that was unnecessary. My program works just as well, (and I think is 
a lot easier!) Besides, the instructions never say to use an array......

This lesson really helped me reinforce my use of static methods, but I still have 
to get used to it. Sometimes, I still get confused by what goes into the method 
header and what is actually used/referenced when the method is called in main(). I 
just call it the same name as to not confuse myself. After all, the method variable 
is just a placeholder for the values I call in the main method.
