I really enjoyed this assignment! I felt that it was a good lesson on how to 
create and use static methods in context. 

Static methods are amazing! When I first heard that I was going to have to change 
my entire programming style from now on, I was skeptical and sad at first. But now 
that I've seen (just a taste of) the efficiency of object-oriented programming in a 
real scenario, I realized just how useful and valuable they are.

Initially, I thought that these static methods were some unusual or unwieldy parts 
of Java, but once I read about it, I realized that it was just a fancy name for a 
function in any other language. Just like how C and C++ run inside a main function 
that calls other functions, Java has a main method that calls other methods. The 
only difference is the method header (and coding language!)
