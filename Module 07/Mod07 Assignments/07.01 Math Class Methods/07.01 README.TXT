This was a really easy assignment and I liked it a lot. It was simple and quick in 
teaching me a concise understanding of the Math class and its methods. It so 
happens that I use phrases like "abs" and "sqrt" in short-hand notes for school, 
so it is easy to remember the syntax. 

The for-loop was easy to do, as well. The arithmetic formula was a simple use of 
algebra skills to solve for y (y = sqrt of (r^2-x^2)) and convert that to code. 

To be sure that all incremented values were shown for the options, I added a bit of 
logic that would change depending on which option you typed in. Using Java's 
default Classes are interesting, but I'm more excited for making my own methods 
with their unique parameters and functions!
