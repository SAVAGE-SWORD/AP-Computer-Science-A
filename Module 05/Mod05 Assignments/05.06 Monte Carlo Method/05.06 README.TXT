This was by far the hardest assignment I've had to do in this course. I found the 
simulation to be extremely difficult. To clarify, reading and writing files is 
simple. It's just constructing an Object and using a loop to write/read data to or 
from a file.

The issue was the logic. To properly calculate the animals before the Blue Jay 
was immensely difficult for me to figure out. It took me several hours of testing 
to debug the nested loop as the assignment truly wants it to be done.

I disliked the difficulty of this file as the assignment that reinforces "file 
writing" techniques. This would be more suited to a module project or challenge 
program!
