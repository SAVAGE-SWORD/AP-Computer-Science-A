1. declare all Objects needed (Scanner, Random, File, PrintWriter..)
2. ask for # of trials
3. simulate according to Monte Carlo Method
4. send simulation data to output file
5. read from output file
6. print results




--Trial pseudocode
ask for trials
	if there are less than 1000 trials
		tell user and ask for new value


--Simulation psuedocode
for each trial
	for random numbers between 0 and 10
		increment the trial count
	if the random number is 10
		exit loop
print trial count to output file
add previous trial count to current trial count
reset trial count to 0

--Read File and Results pseudocode
while the input file has more tokens
	the trial count is the next integer
	the total count is the sum of the previous trial count for all tokens
	increment the count of the target animal (blue jay)
print number of trials
print total count of animals
print total count of blue jays (should equal trials)
compute and print the average animals to blue jays
