I like the idea of reading text files instead of manually entering the information. 
In the future, I'm looking forward to an opportunity of the program asking the user 
to "drag and drop" a file, similar to how I submit FLVS documents!

This assignment was rather similar to the Coin Flip lesson earlier. It just 
took a bit of time to make the while loop and set its conditions. Also, the 
steps for reading the file is similar to how I set up a Scanner. If I knew more 
about Objects, I'd get it much more. However, the examples were enough to just use 
it in this assignment.

The rubric says that percentages should be displayed to 1 or 2 decimal places... 
As far as I am aware, FLVS never mentioned formatting numbers/values, so I had to 
do some research to figure out the DoubleFormat class.
