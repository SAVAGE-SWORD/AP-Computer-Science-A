This was a challenging assignment, yet I found it very interesting. When I first 
read this assignment, I immediately thought of using a String of each of the 
character sets. In fact, I did, and wrote most of the code/logic. It would've used 
charAt random index values for each character set. 

Then I read that Strings or arrays of the sets were not allowed and I was very 
frustrated. So, I redid it by picking random numbers in the character set ranges 
and converting it to chars. Same idea, but a few more steps. :(

The logic section is so long that it was very cumbersome to scroll throught it 
repeatedly every time I wanted to modify/improve something. Also, BlueJ tends to 
get laggy and slow after time. This causes the color highlighted blocks to shift 
and glitch out regularly. And I mean almost all the time. Just scrolling up and 
down will displace all of the pruple/pink/blue color boxes in my logic...

I'll probably switch to Visual Studio for some time and then port it into BlueJ for 
saving/packing/etc.
