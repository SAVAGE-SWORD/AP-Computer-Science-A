Interfaces are a foreign concept to me. I remember in the Picture Lab seeing the 
keyword "implements" but never exactly understood the meaning. Now, I see how it 
works in a practical application.

When I see an interface, at least here, I think of it as another type of abstract 
class but with a few differences. Basically, it's a more generic form of an 
abstract class, as it is not tied to a hierarchy and contains the most basic of 
code, for the sake of flexibility and usability.

In larger projects, I can see how it would apply to multiple class hierarchies, but 
for these APCS assignments, it seems simpler to just use an abstract class, as they 
share many similarities...
