This one took a long time! There was so much to do in this project! But it was a 
lot of fun in the beginning when I was changing the pixel colors. I always saw 
those filter effects on my phone and camera and wondered how they are able to 
change the color of a digital picture. But now I can do it myself! Of all the 
color modifications I did, the grayscale one was the most interesting.

The mirror methods were more difficult for me at first. I had issues trying to 
understand the logic behind what I needed to "copy" and mirror. In the end, I used 
a bit of trial and error and I learned how to traverse the image from top to bottom 
and left to right in order to mirror it properly.
