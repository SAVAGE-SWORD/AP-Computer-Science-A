I really liked this assignment. I had to use my own intuition and knowledge of 
coding and programming to figure out the pattern to most efficiently solve the 
scenario. 
I immediately understood how to do the numTests variable, using the increment 
operator to do so. For the total points, my original method did not work and I was 
confused. I remembered that the += operator would make it such that the 
totalPoints would be equal to the previous totalPoints plus the current points 
(grade) of the test I was coding, which solved my dilemma. 
Once I created the first test in code, every other test was the same code segment 
with a different starting test grade, which I assume was the point of the 
assignment: to create a universally applicable program for the situation. 
Also, I forgot to add the (double) cast to the averages, and I kept getting an 
output ending in #.0. I reread the lesson instructions and figured out that I 
needed casting to get an accurate average per test. I'm really happy that I 
"solved" my first assignment! (even with all the guidance I received...)
