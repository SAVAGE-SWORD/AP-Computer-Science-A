I enjoyed the concept of money conversion for this assignment. I like the fact that 
I was able to look up exchange rates, set them as variables, and use the variables 
to quickly convert the miscellaneous values to USD. 

I now understand the value of assigning variables instead of using raw constant 
numbers. It makes the coding much easier and optimized. 

For my exchange rate information, I googled "exchange rate" and picked out from the 
list of available currencies to convert.

The one part I was slightly confused about at first was the Souvenir section. I did 
not initially understand that the "total items" line was referring to the total 
number of items that could be bought with the budget and cost parameters set. Once 
I figured that out, it was just simple division. The "funds remaining" came easily 
to me, as I knew that when something is "remaining," I am calculating the subtraction 
or modulus of an expression, and subtraction was prohibited here.
