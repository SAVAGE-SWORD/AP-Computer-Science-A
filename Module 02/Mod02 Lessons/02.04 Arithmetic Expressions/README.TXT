I am excited that I was finally introduced to mathematics and the assignment of variables.
I like the fact that it's easy to code math; just type the numbers with some operator(s) 
and it'll produce the result.

I do like the fact that the lesson requires us to add the original values in to create the full 
expression, but I keep forgetting to add the extra + in between each variable and operator. 
I would forget to concatenate with the + because of all the other operators in the code.

Also, I wish I could set my variables to easier names. The rubric requires that they 
be meaningful names, but I would normally just use a, b, c...etcetra.

This type of coding seems very monotonous and unrefined, but I hope I learn new skills 
to make this easier and more efficient for me to do.
