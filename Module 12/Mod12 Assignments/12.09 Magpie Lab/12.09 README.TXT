This, being my first lab, was definitely a new experience for me. I really 
appreciate the new approaches to learning different aspects of coding in Java and 
just how diverse the capabilties can be! 

I've always known about conversation bots, especially a particularly intelligent 
one called "Cleverbot." It's cool to see how these programs respond to keywords, 
but it also show me how difficult it is to create an "intelligent" program. High 
level programmers actually implement AI and bot training to self-improve, because 
it is impossible to know every keyword a human can possibly ask, and to hardcode 
it in the bot.

While I do enjoy this type of assignment, I still prefer the "simpler" way of 
lessons and assignment projects, like most of the first segment.
 I have fixed the Magpie2 java file and added comments that indicate where my added responses, keywords, etc. are located. Sorry!
