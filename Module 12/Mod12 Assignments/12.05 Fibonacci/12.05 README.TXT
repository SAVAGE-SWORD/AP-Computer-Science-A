This assigment was definitely interesting. I enjoyed the concept of making the 
Fibonacci sequence in code! That was a lot of fun!

I had some initial trouble with the base case. I only used 0 and 1, but forgot that 
I needed 2, or else the integer n would be negative! In the end, I figured it out. 
Recursion is not nearly as bad as I anticipated. I'm still used to iterative 
coding, but I will definitely try to use more recursion whenever possible. 

As long as I can think of the situation like a piecewise function, I think I can 
deduce what to do. I just need more exposure to sort it all out in my head!
