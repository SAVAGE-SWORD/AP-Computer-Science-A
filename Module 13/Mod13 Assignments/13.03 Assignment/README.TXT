Polymorphism is a really neat trick. I remember the difficulty in the last project 
to declare each instance of the each Object under the corresponding Class, but now 
with polymorphism, I can just do it all under the superclass! That makes this so 
much easier.

The ArrayList that holds each polymorphed Class Object also made it so much easier 
to run the code, as well. I might need to brush up on the syntax and formatting of 
ArrayLists in the future.
