This was a nice assignment and I liked the topic. It was fun to choose my own idea 
in regards to what to do for an assignment. At first, I wasn't sure what object I 
could use that required calculations, but after some time, I settled on a bicycle 
trip/journey.

I've gotten much more proficient at using static methods and using them to make my 
code in a procedural fashion. It's really useful and I really like it.

OOP is a neat technique, but I don't quite (yet) see its purpose. I understand that 
it involves creating an Object and invoking the static methods through the Object. 
What I don't understand is why. Soon, I'm sure I will see a proper application of 
OOP and why it is so highly encouraged. 

But if given a static method called myMethod, and a class Object called myClass, 
myMethod(); is the same thing as myClass.myMethod(); and, so far in the course, can 
be used interchangeably with no real benefit in terms of code layout and structure?
