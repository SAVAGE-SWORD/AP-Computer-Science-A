I really enjoyed this assignment a lot. It was a lot of fun redoing an old project 
in a new way. At first, I thought that this would be a very hard assignment, but as 
I did it, I was surprised. Using OOP has become simple and easy for me all of a 
sudden!

The original project required user input, so I insisted that I keep that same idea 
for this one. I was really happy when each object correctly stored the unique dart 
count I typed in and computed the values of pi accordingly.

With the old project, it only looked at one dart count and trial size entered by 
user. But with OOP, I was able to make the code do much much more than originally 
possible: being able to process multiple, unique dart counts each in a different 
object!
 
OOP, simply put, increased the overall flexibility and adaptability of my code!
