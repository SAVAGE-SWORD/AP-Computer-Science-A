Wow! This assignment was really cool because I got to reuse an old assignment and 
tweak it to show what I've learned! From last time, reading the next lessons have 
actually answered the question I asked in the last PMR. What I figured out is that 
you can create multiple Objects and invoke generalized source code on for specific 
purposes. The reason for using a separate class with private instances is for 
generalizing the code to account for the Objects being used.

Basically, what I learned is that OOP lets you make code independent and 
unattached to a single program. Now I see why Java is an OOP language...

I need to practice more in creating loaded constructors with private instances and 
creating Objects according to those parameters.
