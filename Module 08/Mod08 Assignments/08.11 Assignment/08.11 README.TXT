This was a nice assignment. I'm getting the hang of OOP now. As I do more of these 
assignments, I get progressively better at the work. What took me over 15 minutes 
to plan out and write, I can do in 5 minutes due to experience.

ArrayLists are amazing! Just the ability to change the size is awesome all on its 
own, not even counting the add, remove, or set methods. Of course, the only 
downside is that the data type has to be an object, but that isn't hard to work 
around.

In this assignment, I used Javadocs to add descriptions to each method. Will this 
be a requirement in future assignments, or am I free to choose whether to add them 
or not?
