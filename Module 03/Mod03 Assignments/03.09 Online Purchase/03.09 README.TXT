This assignment was very similar to 03.07's lesson on accepting user input, but 
here we had to create our own project with a focus.

I like the idea of making our own "online purchase" program that can receive 
input to then process a payment and create a receipt from the information. 

I'm still not qutie used to parsing the data, such as the "tickets" String to get 
the number of tickets. Also, I did the same thing for the PIN to make a 
somewhat elaborate formula for an order number.

Also, while I did correctly "hide" the account number as intended, I wish I knew 
a better way to do so. The code just takes a substring of the last four digits, 
but it cannot account for if the card number does not fit the exact length. If 
I tried to use indexOf to find the hypens (dashes), it would have only given me 
the first one and it wouldn't work correctly. Still, I'm happy how it turned out 
and I'm sorry I'm slightly late with this assignment!
