Making ASCII art has always been a fun habit of mine in my free time. 
I would design simplistic works of art in a text editor and share it online, 
but I never thought I'd make one with Java! 

This assignment was interesting, but took too long. Creating it was not difficult, 
but formatting it was. I had to repeat by trial-and-error until I created the 
art correctly. Since I did it in a psuedo-3D style, that made things more challenging 
(and fun). 

While I liked the idea of this project, I found it to be cumbersome and a bad 
example of using escape sequences, even if it's main focus is formatting. 
Nonetheless, I still learned something pretty cool this time, and I hope I can find 
a way to apply this to real life.
