Finally! I finally got a chance to use user input in code instead of pre-defined 
numbers and symbols. I am really excited about how complex I can take this user 
interaction in Java. I'm sure there are many practical applications and many more 
forms of input other than the Scanner class.

I find the syntax of Scanner to be a bit too cumbersome and long. You have to first 
create the object by assigning it as an int, double, or other type like a String, 
then you have to create the "new" Scanner. I don't exactly understand why you need 
to include the (System.in) parameter to the Scanner for it to function.

Regardless, it took some formatting for me to figure out how to set the user input 
to a variable and call it in the testGrade variable for the existing formulas and 
text responses.

Lastly, I'm sorry if you found my coded responses to be a bit corny!
