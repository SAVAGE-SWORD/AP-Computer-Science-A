# AP-Computer-Science-A
All project files for AP Computer Science A online through Florida Virtual School

You may do as you please with these projects in any capacity you desire.

If you choose to download (and run) any of these for yourself, you do not need the .ctxt or the .class files within each project. All you need is the .java file or files!

Please feel free to share this repository with others so they can benefit from these projects, as well.

I hope these projects serve as a useful resource and nurture a love of coding in your heart.
