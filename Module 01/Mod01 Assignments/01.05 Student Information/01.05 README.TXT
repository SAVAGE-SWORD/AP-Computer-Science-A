I already have some background information about coding, though not in Java.
Still, the logic is fundamentally the same in that you have functions (methods),
lines that must end in semicolons, and the need for strings and arguments
which are later to come, for sure. I tried to make the this file look as neat
as possible, which is hard when all I'm really told to use is the print and 
println methods. It takes a lot of lines of code writing it this way and I wish I
could do it simpler.

It's been a long time since I've coded anything "in-depth" other than simple
debugging and breakpoints, so I'm a bit rusty when it comes to my syntax and
correctness in typing. It took me a few tries to adjust the spacing and visual
appearance of the output to get it the way I wanted (given the circumstances of 
the assignment.) Also, I noticed the BlueJ is very slow and has a tendency to lag
behind a few seconds when I'm coding. It even crashed from timing out for so long,
but I can't say why that's happening. Shouldn't be my fault.

In summary, I'm excited to improve my skills and learn some complex coding and
build truly useful programs with Java. I had little to no trouble making this 
program work as intended and had no compilation errors in its creation.
