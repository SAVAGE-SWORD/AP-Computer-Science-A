I already have some background information about coding, though not in Java.
Still, the logic is fundamentally the same in that you have functions (methods),
lines that must end in semicolons, and the need for strings and arguments
which are later to come, for sure.

It's been a long time since I've coded anything "in-depth" other than simple
debugging and breakpoints, so I'm a bit rusty when it comes to my syntax and
correctness in typing.

In summary, I'm excited to improve my skills and learn some complex coding and
build truly useful programs with Java.
