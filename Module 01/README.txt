All project files for AP Computer Science A online through Florida Virtual School

You may do as you please with these projects, whether you totally copy them or use them to learn.

If you choose to download (and run) any of these for yourself, you do not need the .ctxt or the .class files within each project. All you need is the .java file or files!

I hope these projects serve as a useful resource for any aspiring computer science student and/or a programmer.
