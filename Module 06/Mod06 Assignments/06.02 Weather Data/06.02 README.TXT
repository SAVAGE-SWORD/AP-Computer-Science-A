This was a rather easy assignment, yet time-consuming. This assignment was like a 
review on a variety of things: arithmetic functions, data conversion, and how to 
effectively use if and for logic loops. The logic section was straightforward to 
me, at least. I knew what I had to do when I saw that units were involved: use 
logic to convert to the proper units and display them as necessary.

On the more excited note, I love printf()! It is so simple to use and it just comes 
naturally to me! At first, it took some time to test different widths until I liked 
the formatting, but once I got it down, it became very easy. I liked how I could 
offset the text, as well. I used an empty String "" with a width modifier of how 
long I want. No more holding down the spacebar any longer!

When you think about it, the syntax (%...) is just an inline placeholder variable 
for the other variables/values after the comma(s), in their respective order.

I also took some time to read about printf() and the other format specifiers in 
greater detail, so my next assignment might be even better looking than this one!
