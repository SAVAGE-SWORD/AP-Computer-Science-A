This took a long, long time...I don't even want to say how long this took. Still, 
this assignment was interesting in that it was a complete review of everything 
that was taught so far in the course.

In difficulty and the length of work to do, this was probably the hardest 
assignment yet. It took a long time to do each task (from the instructions) in code 
and then go back when I need to do more things. The for-each loop is nice, but only 
applicable in a few scenarios. For the arrays, I would normally have only used 
the values based on the year range. Thus, I'd have many more opportunities to use 
for-each statements (and save time!) However, I had to read the entire file to 
the arrays, even if the data will not be used. This makes me add another 
if-statement, which will not work with for-each loops (in my case.) *sigh*

Overall, I'm sure there are some areas that are a bit rough and inefficient. I 
need to work on streamlining my code...
