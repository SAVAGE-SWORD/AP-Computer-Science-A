I really had fun with this project, but I'm also kind of happy that it is finally 
over! Alas, this was very interesting in learning how to copy specific parts of 
certain images and put them on a "canvas" of another picture, which fascinated me 
greatly.

The edge detection method was also really cool to play around with and I 
think my solution to the method is unique and more interesting of a technique. It 
is better to compare it from the bottom and right, since left and top pixels would 
be the same thing in their own methods, if applicable. Also, this leads to more 
refined edge detection with more efficient code, so I'm rather proud of that, even 
though it wasn't much at all...
