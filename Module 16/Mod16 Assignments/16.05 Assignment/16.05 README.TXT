I took some time to really learn these algorithms and how they worked in the 
previous assignments and how to optimize them for the future. When it comes to 
checking for null elements, ArrayLists are much easier to use, as you don't need to 
check!

There was an issue that I was unsure about. I got a very unusual error message: 
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space. In my original version of this work, 
there was no break lines to terminate the loops. So does that mean that Java had 
too many Objects in memory that it couldn't send to the garbage collector? Or was 
this just a fluke error on my part? To be safe, I added a break line to every 
method that modified the gradebook, anyway.
