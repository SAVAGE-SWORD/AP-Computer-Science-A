The insertions part of this assignment was as I expected. It was simple, intuitive, 
and straightforward to implement, as long as I used the Virtual Lecture Notes as my 
guide to do it correctly.

However, the deletions algorithm really confused me. It wasn't so much the act of 
removing the element from the array or ArrayList that confused me, but the part of 
adapting the code to account for nulls. I knew how to traverse the data structures 
but wasn't sure the right way to detect for null elements in the array.

My way of doing it works, but it took me lots of trial and error to make it run 
correctly. Even now, my knowledge on this is a a bit fuzzy, but I'll figure it 
out in due time.
