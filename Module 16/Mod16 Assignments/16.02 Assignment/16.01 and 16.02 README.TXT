This was easier than I thought this assignment would be. I understand that the goal 
is to understand traversing and replacing arrays and their elements, but I think 
it is slightly tedious. After all, 90% of the V2 and V4 files are copied and 
pasted from the V1 and V3 files, respectively, with a few changes in the methods.

Nevertheless, it was interesting seeing how replacement worked. I know that the 
instructions ask that I search the candidate by name, but that is a flawed idea. 
It would be much easier to assign each candidate a number and modify the data by 
each candidate's corresponding order, which would significantly reduce user error 
if this were an interactive assignment.
