The lesson content has definitely gotten more difficult now. Nevertheless, I think 
it is really cool to sort an array by different parameters in question. The 
algorithm I used is just basically the same as the lesson explains it, but I made 
minor adjustments for neatness and clarity. The only difference between an 
ascending or descending order is just the conditional operator in the if-statement, 
which intrigued me, because I could basically reuse the exact same code but just 
change the value of comparison with the correct getter method!
