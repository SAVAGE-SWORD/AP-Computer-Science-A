This assignment took me a surprisingly long time compared to the others. I enjoyed 
the idea of taking gender (another condition) into account. After all, creating a 
program that can take both genders into account is very difficult and meticulous, 
creating so many conditions for each scenario.

When I did the logical if-else blocks, I had a choice. I know that the previous 
lesson literally emphasizes the use of && and other logical operators to deal 
with the different circumstances and multiple conditions. However, I felt that 
doing this would be too repetitive. I could have set my isMale boolean in each and 
every if-condition, and that is probably the way most people would have done it. 
Instead, I wrapped the if-else block for the menu items in the if-else block that 
tests if the gender is male or not.

I wrapped the if-else in the if-else because I found it more efficient, so I am 
sorry if it's "breaking the rules" for this assignment! On another note, comparing 
the Strings and parsing the data for the calculations was not a problem, as other 
assignments and lessons have already reinforced that knowledge. I am confident that 
I have fully understood Module 4 and everything it taught me about logic in Java.
