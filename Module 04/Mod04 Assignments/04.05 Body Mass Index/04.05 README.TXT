I am happy that I finally got to the true "meat and potatoes" of Java: logic. 
I have always like using if-else logic blocks, each with their own branch. Of 
course, I like more complex logic problems, like while and for loops because they 
take more depth of knowledge and critical thinking to optimize the code.

If-else statements are simpler than most of the things I have already learned in 
this course. To me, it is like writing pseudocode (literally!) with a bit of 
intuition involved. I'm used to coding where it requires curly braces after the 
condition, but not parentheses around them, so I tend to get that mixed up. 
I'll have it worked out soon enough.

Also, I hope you like my rating system "gag" at the end of my code. It was fun 
adding the score system and each code block to execute in response. When I tested 
it out and saw it work properly, it made me really happy. It took a bit of time to 
do, but I hope it brought a smile to your face!
