This assignment was much easier than some of the work assigned in Module 8. I like 
that it makes me use OOP, but gives me the creativity on how I want to go about it. 
Originally, I was intending to use an ArrayList with each object being a new 
speed and angle, but I chose to do it differently.

When I was first taught OOP, the lessons encouraged that I use multiple methods 
that do individual tasks to the private instance variables (mutate and then get). 

However, for this project I wanted to do an experiment on how simplistic I could 
keep the code, especially by using as few methods as I needed, reasonably. 
Ultimately, this kept my Tester class extremely clean, as it only needs to call a 
single method for the program to work! For the sake of this course, is this an 
encouraged practice, or should I not do it this way?
